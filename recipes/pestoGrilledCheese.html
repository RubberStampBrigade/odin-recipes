    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>I first had this pesto grilled cheese sandwich at a small restaurant and immediately went home to duplicate the recipe. I've been making my grilled cheese sandwiches this way ever since!</p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoon of unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>4 slices Italian bread.</li>
        <li>Two table spoons of homemade or store bought green pesto. </li>
        <li>2 slices of tomato.</li>
        <li>4 slices of preffered cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>Steps..</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread butter on one side of a slice of bread and place it, buttered side down, into a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the pesto sauce on the unbuttered side of the bread. Stack one slice of cheese, tomato, and a second slice of cheese on top of pesto, in that order.</li>
        <li>Flip 2 pieces of the bread over and spread 1/2 tablespoon pesto onto each.</li>
        <li>Spread remaining pesto sauce on second slice of bread. Place it pesto side down onto sandwich in the pan. Butter the top side of bread.</li>
        <li>Gently fry sandwich, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
