    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>Steak sandwiches are always a hit, and this Italian Steak Sandwich with pesto, grilled red peppers, and melted provolone, is a knockout. If you're hosting a potluck or picnic anytime soon — and looking to up your game — this sandwich is the answer.</p>
    <p>The key to a great sandwich is the bread. Meaning “slipper” in Italian, ciabatta is a great option, and with its round shape and similar texture, focaccia is a good substitute. Both can stand up to the generous amount of toppings, but regardless of shape, the bread's freshness is tantamount.</p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large red bell peppers.</li>
        <li>1 ½ lb. top sirloin steak, trimmed.</li>
        <li>Olive oil.</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>1 loaf ciabatta, halved lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Packet of slices of preffered cheese.</li>
        <li>1 cup purchased refrigerated basil pesto.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>Steps..</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium-high. Brush grill grate with oil.</li>
        <li>Grill peppers, covered, until charred on all sides, about ⏰ 10 minutes; transfer peppers to a bowl and let cool. Remove and discard skins and seeds, then slice peppers into strips.</li>
        <li>Coat steak with oil, then season with salt and pepper. Grill steak to desired doneness, ⏰ 5–7 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a plate, tent with foil, and let rest ⏰ 5–7 minutes; slice into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Brush cut sides of ciabatta with oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill ciabatta, cut sides down, covered, until toasted, ⏰ 1–2 minutes. Spread pesto on grilled sides of ciabatta and top with provolone.</li>
        <li>Grill ciabatta on foil, cheese sides up, covered, until cheese melts, about ⏰ 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, arrange peppers and steak on bottom half of ciabatta, then top with remaining ciabatta half and cut into 8 servings.</li>
    </ol>
