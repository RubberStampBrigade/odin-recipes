    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>A chicken panini sandwich has become a standard lunch menu item and favored by both children and adults. This version uses pre-grilled chicken, prepared pesto, cheese, and precooked bacon, all of which are layered in between bread and grilled until crispy.</p>
    <p>You can use rotisserie chicken or even deli chicken breast instead of grilled if you like. To switch things up, try different cheeses like mozzarella or goat cheese, or use kale pesto in place of the basil in this panini. To serve, you can simply toss some chips on the plate, or accompany this hot sandwich with a salad of mixed greens, pasta salad, or french fries.</p>
